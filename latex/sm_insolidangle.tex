\-This method selects a subset of particles that are located in a solid angle defined by a center and a set of points. \-The solid angle is constructed as a union of small cones whose axis goes through the center and a point. \-So there's such a cone for each position, and a point is in the solid angle if it lies within any of these cones. \-The width of the cones can be adjusted.
