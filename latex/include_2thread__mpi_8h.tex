\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-Convenience header file for non-\/\-M\-P\-I compatibility. \-This file includes the t\-M\-P\-I header file thread\-\_\-mpi/tmpi.\-h, as well as thread\-\_\-mpi/threads.\-h and thread\-\_\-mpi/atomic.\-h header files. \-If you'd like to use the components individually, include the relevant header files directly.
